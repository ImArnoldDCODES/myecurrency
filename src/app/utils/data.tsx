export const questions = [
  {
    question: "Q1: How does it work?",
    answer:
      "Inhaling on the diffuser will turn the inside liquids (melatonin, lavender, chamomile) into a light mist which you inhale, and then exhale out your nose. Inhaling the melatonin allows for a near-instant effect, and also allows you to experience the soothing aromatherapeutic effect of lavender and chamomile.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q2: Why inhale melatonin?",
    answer:
      "Inhaling melatonin can provide faster absorption and quicker effects compared to oral supplements, as it bypasses the digestive system and directly enters the bloodstream through the lungs. This method may help users fall asleep faster and offers a more convenient way to use melatonin for relaxation and sleep aid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q3: How much melatonin is there per inhale?",
    answer: "The amount of melatonin per inhale can vary depending on the specific product and its formulation. Typically, inhalable melatonin products are designed to deliver a small, controlled dose with each inhale, often ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg. For accurate dosing information, it's important to refer to the product packaging or manufacturer's guidelines, as this can vary between different brands and products.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q4: Is it an e-cigarette or tobacco product?",
    answer: "No, an inhalable melatonin diffuser is not an e-cigarette or tobacco product. It is specifically designed for aromatherapy and wellness purposes, using plant-based ingredients like melatonin, essential oils, and natural extracts. Unlike e-cigarettes, it does not contain nicotine, tobacco, or other harmful chemicals commonly found in vaping products.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q5: What's in it?",
    answer: "Melatonin, Essentail Oils, Natural Flavours, Carrier Ingredients",
  },
  {
    question: "Q6: What's not in it?",
    answer: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Q7: How long does it last?",
    answer: "The duration of an inhalable melatonin diffuser can vary based on factors such as the frequency of use and the size of the device. Typically, these diffusers can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. On average, a single diffuser might provide around 200 to 400 puffs. If used regularly, such as a few puffs per night, it could last for about 2 to 4 weeks. For the most accurate estimate, refer to the specific product guidelines provided by the manufacturer.",

    question: "Q8: How do I know it has run out/died?",
